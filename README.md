# 🍽️ Recipe Finder

A fun and simple web app that helps you **find delicious recipes** based on the ingredients you have at home.  
Just type in a few ingredients (comma separated), and Recipe Finder will fetch matching recipes for you using [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).  

✨ If there’s a recipe that includes **all your ingredients**, it will be prioritized.  
If not, you’ll still get creative ideas with recipes containing at least one of them!
